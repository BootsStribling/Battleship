## About the creation: 
I started this game with the intention of diving into a very difficult game for my beginner level and working hard to learn what was needed to produce something fun. Having one week to complete this project, I definitely found my struggle and stride throughout its creation. Execution is the most difficult part of any project and I found myself ice-boxing items I never would have expected to ice-box. I hope you enjoy the game as is. I'm continuing to adjust, fix bugs, and add features. Enjoy Battleship from Boots Stribling!
